# Overview
This project analyzes the sales of different types of pizzas over time. It includes details like how many pizzas were sold, the revenue made, the most and least popular pizzas, and daily order trends. The goal is to understand customer preferences and improve business decisions.

# Aim
The main aim is to study pizza sales data to identify:
1) Total revenue and number of pizzas sold.
2) Best and worst-selling pizzas.
3) Trends in customer orders (e.g., which days have the most orders).
4) Average order value and quantity per order.

# Analysis
Total Revenue: Around $817,860.

Total Orders: 21,350 orders.

Total Pizzas Sold: 49,574 pizzas.

Average Order Value: $38.31.

Average Pizzas per Order: 2.32.

Best-Selling Pizzas:

Hawaiian Pizza (2,422 sold)

Pepperoni Pizza (2,418 sold)

Thai Chicken Pizza (2,371 sold)

**Daily Trends:**

Most orders are on Saturdays and Fridays.

Least orders are on Sundays.

# Purpose of the Dashboard (Extended)
The main purpose of the Pizza Sales Dashboard is to turn raw data into easy-to-understand visuals that support better business decisions. Instead of going through hundreds of rows in a spreadsheet, the dashboard provides a quick overview of what's happening in the business.

Here‚Äôs why the dashboard is useful:
**Quick Performance Check:** Business owners or managers can instantly see how the pizza shop is performing in terms of revenue, number of orders, and total pizzas sold.

**Identify Customer Preferences:** By looking at the most and least popular pizzas, the business can understand which products are in high demand and which ones might need improvement or removal from the menu.

**Improve Marketing and Offers:** Knowing which days have the highest or lowest sales can help in planning special deals or discounts to increase sales on slow days.

**Track Growth and Trends:** Over time, the dashboard helps track progress, compare past performance, and spot trends in customer behavior.

**Better Inventory Planning:** Understanding which ingredients or pizza types sell the most helps in managing stock and reducing waste.

**Decision Making Made Easy:** Whether it‚Äôs for pricing, promotions, staffing, or inventory, the dashboard gives insights that support smart and timely decisions.



# üß© Role of SQL Queries in the Analysis
SQL (Structured Query Language) was used to extract, filter, and analyze the pizza sales data stored in tables. It played an important role in organizing the data before visualizing it in the dashboard.

**‚úÖ Why SQL Was Used:**
**Data Cleaning:** To remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format the data properly.

**Filtering Data:** To focus on specific time periods, pizza types, or categories for detailed analysis.

**Grouping and Aggregation:** SQL GROUP BY and aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() were used to calculate:

Total revenue

Number of orders

Average order value

Sales by pizza size or category

Joining Tables: SQL JOIN was used to combine different tables (e.g., orders, pizzas, ingredients) to get complete information for each transaction.

Trend Analysis: SQL queries helped in identifying trends like most popular order days and top-selling pizzas over time.

**üîç Example Use Cases:**
Finding the top 5 best-selling pizzas

Calculating the total sales per month

Identifying which day of the week gets the most orders

Checking the average number of pizzas sold per order

**üöÄ Why SQL is Important in Data Projects:**
Using SQL helps you prepare data efficiently and accurately before creating dashboards or reports. It ensures the analysis is based on correct and meaningful data.
