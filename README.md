# Overview
This project analyzes the sales of different types of pizzas over time. It includes details like how many pizzas were sold, the revenue made, the most and least popular pizzas, and daily order trends. The goal is to understand customer preferences and improve business decisions.

# Aim
The main aim is to study pizza sales data to identify:
1) Total revenue and number of pizzas sold.
2) Best and worst-selling pizzas.
3) Trends in customer orders (e.g., which days have the most orders).
4) Average order value and quantity per order.

# Analysis
- Total Revenue: Around $817,860.
- Total Orders: 21,350 orders.
- Total Pizzas Sold: 49,574 pizzas.
- Average Order Value: $38.31.
- Average Pizzas per Order: 2.32.
- Best-Selling Pizzas:
- Hawaiian Pizza (2,422 sold)
- Pepperoni Pizza (2,418 sold)
- Thai Chicken Pizza (2,371 sold)

**Daily Trends:**

Most orders are on Saturdays and Fridays.

Least orders are on Sundays.

# Purpose of the Dashboard
The dashboard provides a clear and quick summary of the pizza sales data. It helps users easily understand key business metrics like total revenue, 
top-selling pizzas, order trends, and customer preferences.

By turning raw data into charts and visuals, the dashboard supports better decision-making, improves sales strategies, and helps track overall performance.




#  Role of SQL Queries in the Analysis

** Why SQL Was Used:**
**Data Cleaning:** To remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format the data properly.

**Filtering Data:** To focus on specific time periods, pizza types, or categories for detailed analysis.

**Grouping and Aggregation:** SQL GROUP BY and aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() were used to calculate:

1) Total revenue
2) Number of orders
3) Average order value
4) Sales by pizza size or category

**Trend Analysis:** SQL queries helped in identifying trends like most popular order days and top-selling pizzas over time.

** Example Use Cases:**
Finding the top 5 best-selling pizzas

Calculating the total sales per month

Identifying which day of the week gets the most orders

Checking the average number of pizzas sold per order

** Why SQL is Important in Data Projects:**
Using SQL helps you prepare data efficiently and accurately before creating dashboards or reports. It ensures the analysis is based on correct and meaningful data.
